>>>> IMPORTANT <<<<

Please run the following program OUTSIDE of IDLE. User experience will differ inside of an IDLE environment.

*Note*
This is due to os.system('cls') not clearing outputs in the shell. The command runs fine on Windows Machines when run standalone in a command prompt window.


>>>> OPERATION <<<<

Download/Pull repository.
Right click on Magic8Ball.py > Open.

The program will loop indefinetly in case of multiple questions.
